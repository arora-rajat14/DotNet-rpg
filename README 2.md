## Project Detail
The back-end application I built is a small text-based role-playing game where different users can register (I used JSON web tokens for authentication) and create their own characters like a mage or a knight,
add some skills and a weapon, and also let the characters fight against each other to see who is the best of them all.

## To Run the project
